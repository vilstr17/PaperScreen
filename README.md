# PaperScreen
 
A lightweight macOS utility that adds a subtle grain overlay across your screen to take the edge off harsh, glossy displays. It works on contrast and texture rather than color temperature, so your whites stay white.
 
Runs invisibly above every app, click-through, on every display, and stays out of your way.

## Requirements
 
- macOS 15.0+

## Download & Installation

- Download the latest PaperScreen.dmg from the Releases page:
    https://github.com/Bearbobs/PaperScreen/releases
- Open the downloaded DMG file,Drag PaperScreen.app into your Applications folder.
- Launch PaperScreen from Applications.
- The app will appear in your macOS menu bar.

### Opening the App (Unsigned Build)

PaperScreen isn't notarized or signed with an Apple Developer certificate, so macOS Gatekeeper will block it on first launch with a message like *"PaperScreen.app" is damaged and can't be opened* or *can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software*. This is expected for an open-source, self-distributed app — here's how to open it anyway:

**Option 1: System Settings**
1. Try to open PaperScreen normally (double-click) — it will be blocked.
2. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.
3. Scroll down to the Security section, where you'll see a message about PaperScreen being blocked.
4. Click **Open Anyway**.
5. Confirm by clicking **Open Anyway** again if prompted.

**Option 2: Terminal (if the above shows "damaged" instead of a security prompt)**
This happens because macOS strips the quarantine flag differently depending on how the DMG was downloaded. Run:
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/PaperScreen.app
```
Then launch PaperScreen normally.

> **Why this happens:** Apple requires a paid Developer ID ($99/year) to notarize apps for smooth Gatekeeper approval. As a free, open-source project, PaperScreen doesn't currently use one. You can always verify what you're running by checking the source in this repo or building it yourself with Xcode.

## How It Works
 
1. **Overlay window** — a borderless, transparent window is created per screen at the highest window level.
2. **Texture generation** — Core Image's random noise generator is blurred and level-adjusted to produce an organic grain.
3. **Compositing** — the noise layer is applied, which darkens highlights and reduces perceived contrast without shifting hue — the effect of a physical matte screen protector, in software.

## Note on the attempted privacy shield

This fork also experimented with a software privacy shield (oblique-angle grain techniques, dynamic dithering, a blurred-veil mode, face-tracked spotlight via Vision/on-device camera detection, and finally a system-blur overlay with a cursor-following clear circle). None of the approaches produced a satisfying result: the effects were either too weak to actually block shoulder-surfing, too disruptive to everyday use, or both. All of that code has been removed — this fork now carries only the original paper overlay plus per-app exclusion, opacity/texture settings and persistence.

If you want a real privacy filter, a physical clip-on screen filter is still the only thing that genuinely works. We decided the software approach was not worth it.
